Sqwiggle SDK for iOS
================

Documentation coming soon. Code is a Work in Progress, but feel free to start playing around if you wish!

This is an Objective-C wrapper for the Sqwiggle API. Right now, we only support iOS, but in a short while we'll officially add support for Mac OS X as well.

Installation
---------------
If you use [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/), simply the following to your Podfile:<br />
  <code>pod 'Sqwiggle', '~> 0.1.0'</code>
    
More information
---------------
Documentation is still a work in progress, but mosey on over to [Sqwiggle.h](https://github.com/sqwiggle/sqwiggle-ios-sdk/blob/master/iOSSDK/Sqwiggle.h) to see what helper methods are available to help you retreive data from our server. All methods are well-documented in that file to help with integration. Also visit [The Sqwiggle API documention](https://www.sqwiggle.com/docs/overview/getting-started) for even more info.
